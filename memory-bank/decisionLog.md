## Decision

-   2025-07-13 01:22:40 - Multi-crate workspace architecture adopted for ferrous-llm

## Rationale

-   Separation of concerns: Each LLM provider has its own crate for focused development
-   Modularity: Users can depend only on the providers they need, reducing binary size
-   Maintainability: Provider-specific code is isolated, making updates and bug fixes easier
-   Core abstraction: Common traits and types are centralized in ferrous-llm-core
-   Memory management: Dedicated crate for conversation context and memory handling

## Implementation Details

-   ferrous-llm-core: Contains shared traits, types, error handling, and configuration
-   Provider crates: ferrous-llm-openai, ferrous-llm-anthropic, ferrous-llm-ollama
-   Each provider implements the core traits with provider-specific optimizations
-   Examples demonstrate usage patterns and integration approaches
-   Integration tests validate cross-provider compatibility and functionality
