## Coding Patterns

-   **Provider Trait Implementation**: Each provider crate implements core traits from ferrous-llm-core
-   **Error Handling**: Consistent error types and propagation across all crates using Result<T, E>
-   **Configuration**: Structured configuration types for each provider with validation
-   **Async/Await**: Asynchronous patterns for all network operations and streaming
-   **Type Safety**: Strong typing for requests, responses, and configuration parameters

## Architectural Patterns

-   **Workspace Organization**: Multi-crate workspace with clear separation of concerns
-   **Trait-Based Abstraction**: Core functionality defined as traits, implemented by providers
-   **Modular Dependencies**: Each crate declares only necessary dependencies
-   **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive tests validating provider implementations
-   **Example-Driven Documentation**: Working examples demonstrating usage patterns

## Testing Patterns

-   **Unit Tests**: Provider-specific functionality testing within each crate
-   **Integration Tests**: Cross-provider compatibility and core trait validation
-   **E2E Tests**: End-to-end testing with actual provider APIs (where applicable)
-   **Mock Testing**: Isolated testing using mock responses for reliable CI/CD
